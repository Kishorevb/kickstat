# KickStat
Uncover Rare events in Soccer from match data  

In the realm of football analytics, there is a critical need for a comprehensive system capable of identifying and analyzing rare, extraordinary events during matches. These rare events, which often hold key insights into player performance and match dynamics, remain hidden within vast datasets. Traditional analytics fall short in uncovering them. To address this challenge, our project aims to develop 'KickStat,' a sophisticated knowledge graph-based analytics system. KickStat will enable sports analysts to timely and effortlessly pinpoint and study rare occurrences in the world of soccer, enhancing our understanding of the game and offering valuable insights for sports analysts.
